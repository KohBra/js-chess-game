# Chess Game

This is a fun project I did, to explore how to implement the rules of chess. I created it with the intent of 
being strictly a game logic model, and having the GUI be completely separate. I wrote up a simple console GUI 
as both an example of how to use the model, and so that I could test the code/play the game.

DISCLAIMER: I realize its not optimal and can't compare whatsoever to the big name Chess engines. It wasn't my intent to
do so either.
